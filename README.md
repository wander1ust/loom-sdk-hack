## Seeing Beyond

### Beyond the Holidays + Workplace

Although this hack was made with the holidays + professional workplace in mind, I see it extending beyond those boundaries. Not everyone celebrates holidays or has days that they look forward to. A virtual greeting app has the potential to reach so many, including hospital patients, cancer patients, the chronically or terminally ill, anyone down on their luck who has lost their job, home, health or loved one, someone going through a life-changing event, pregnant soon-to-be mothers, etc. Greetings aren't only for holidays and celebrations. Words of support and encouragement can mean a lot, especially during hard times. Each have their own charm, but receiving a direct video message can be a much more personal, engaging, empowering and uplifting experience than a long, heartfelt text message alone.

Mainstream video + photo sharing platforms have also introduced and promoted short form videos. But their application is typically one-to-many, where one creator uploads a video to an audience of viewers. So it’s interesting to see Loom approach video sharing from a different angle. What if content creators, artists, influencers and vloggers could interact with their fans or followers 1-1 via async video messaging? This opens the door for a virtual fan meet and greet that can happen whenever & wherever because video messages aren’t time or location dependent. I believe this is something that both parties could appreciate, with the proper checks in place ofc.

My experience with commenting on the top social video sharing platform hasn't been all the best. I find that I, along with many others, have to keep reposting the same comment under any and every video that a creator uploads until it sticks because the comments automatically get removed at random (it's a hit or a miss)... possibly due to the length of my comments, although I can't say for sure. And the only way to even know whether or not a comment has gone through is to check while logged out. It's a whole tiresome process that can dissuade any viewer from commenting at all. (Ironically, YT's spam filter has only encouraged me to 'spam' even more 😁). All this to say, an advantage of communicating via Loom VM (video message) is that it can save time by possibly getting past those faulty spam text filters and condensing long text messages into easier-to-digest video recordings.

To demonstrate what this could look like, I turned a portion of my long text comments into a video message greeting:

### Text vs Video: Notice the difference?

### Non-Holiday + Non-Work Related Greeting Example

**🍀 Note**: An actual greeting VM would be more natural, more personal & engaging (think inside jokes, personal memos, photo collage, digital art, portraits, caricatures, sketches, spoken word, serenades, storytelling, etc). 

Now, if I sent this VM greeting to someone located halfway across the globe, they could watch it in their own time, replay the message however many times they want/need to hear it, and respond with their own Loom video or comment. This would then start a chain reaction of spreading positive vibes. Bonus points if you can get someone to smile or laugh with your greeting message. 

Not being able to respond to a comment to your comment cuts off the start of any discussion, which defeats the purpose of having a discussion thread in the first place 😑. Async audio messaging, voice memos & voicemail are already convenient communication tools for many. The future of async video adoption looks promising.

### The Weight of a Message
Proof of the <strong>✨</strong> positive impact <strong>✨</strong> that supportive comments & messages can have:
